# E Commerce Backe End

## Purpose

I built this website backed to handle the back end functionallity of an E Commerce store.

## Description and Usage

This backend contains a database of multiple tables for the products and the attributes of the products for a virtual e commerce store. The user is able to obtain information about specific products, categories, and tags for all objects in the database. The user is also able to add new objects, update objects, and delete objects via the different routes.
